/**
 * Jest `setupFiles` entry - runs once per test file, before that file's
 * modules (and so before `AppService`'s constructor, which reads these same
 * variables) are ever required. Points the app at the dedicated test
 * database and forces every behavior flag to a deterministic value,
 * regardless of what the developer's own `server/.env` (or CI's real
 * environment) happens to have set for local development.
 *
 * TRUST_PROXY=true is deliberate here (unlike real deployments, where it's
 * only safe behind an actual reverse proxy): it lets `test/helpers/auth.ts`
 * give each login/register pair its own `X-Forwarded-For` IP, so many tests
 * can each get a fresh bucket against the shared authLimiter (5 req/5min per
 * IP) instead of tripping it after a handful of auth-related tests.
